    <h2>This application has been implemented in the following scenario using ocLazyLoad and requireJs.</h2>
    <ul class="list-group">
        <li class="list-group-item">
            On the landing page, <b>, we have attached landing controllers to the main app</b>.
            We are attaching the <b>controllers and services lazily</b>, we used <b>registerController, $register.factory</b> functionality
            which is defined in the app.config. When the files are loaded lazily the controller and the services will be attached to the main app.
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">
            For home controller, we have <b>used a separate module called "SampleApp.Home"</b>. Therefor after loading the file, we need to inject the module using ocLazyLoad.
            This functionality is implemented in the <b>app.js</b> file at the routing <b>"/home"</b> (see resolve block in code).
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">
            To load page1, we have used the module "SampleApp.Pages". Page1Service.js file has a dependency to page1Controller.js file.
            This dependent file has to loaded before loading the page1Controller.js file.
            <br /> 
            We created the module "SampleApp.Pages" in Page1Service.js file, Since Page1Service.Js file is a parent in the hierarchy.

        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">
            We created a separate routing in "SampleApp.Pages".
        </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">
            We created the controller and services under "SampleApp.Pages" for page2. This page will be loaded lazily after the first module has been loaded.
            We therefore need to register the controllers and services for this.
        </li>
